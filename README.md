Helping to assist in determining a students lab attendance grade

## Download
Download the project as a ZIP file by clicking the Code dropdown -> HTTPS tab -> Download ZIP

## To Run
1. Open Spyder and load in timely_lab_attendance.py
2. Drop excel file in the same directory as the python file
4. Click the run button
5. A new excel file is created and saved; not overriding the original

## Few Notes
- Make sure that the excel file used is formatted the same as the excel template
  - timely_lab_attendance_TEMPLATE.xlsx
- The same excel file can be ran multiple times. The program is designed for multiple executions of the same excel file
- There is a comment block where you can put in the key lab dates and the name of the excel file
  - The excel file MUST have the correct file extension (ie. xlsx)
- You don't need to have all the key lab dates for the semester already keyed in. The program just needs to know what they are
- The max amount of key lab dates is set to four (4). If that needs to change, contact the developer
